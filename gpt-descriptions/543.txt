Synopsis: 
In the small town of Gopher Prairie, Carol Milford, a young and ambitious woman, finds herself torn between her dreams of transforming the town into a cultural haven and the harsh reality of small-town life. As she navigates the complexities of marriage, social expectations, and her own desires, Carol becomes a catalyst for change, challenging the stagnant traditions and narrow-mindedness of Main Street. With wit and insight, Sinclair Lewis paints a vivid portrait of small-town America, exploring the clash between individualism and conformity, and the struggle to find one's true identity in a world that resists change.
