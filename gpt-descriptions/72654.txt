Synopsis: In "The displaying of supposed witchcraft," John Webster explores the world of witchcraft and debunks popular beliefs surrounding it. He argues that while there are deceivers and individuals under the influence of melancholy and imagination, the notion of a physical alliance between witches and the devil, including sexual relations or shape-shifting into animals, is unfounded. Webster also delves into the existence of angels and spirits, the truth behind apparitions, the nature of astral and sydereal spirits, and the power of charms and philters. This work challenges prevailing beliefs about witchcraft and offers a rational perspective on supernatural phenomena.
