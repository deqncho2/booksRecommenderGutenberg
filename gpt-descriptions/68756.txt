Synopsis: 

In 'The danger and immodesty of the present too general custom of unnecessarily employing men-midwives', a series of letters written by an anonymous man-midwife sheds light on a controversial practice that has been silently accepted by society. Through these letters, the author challenges the prevailing notion that men are better suited for the role of midwives, revealing the hidden dangers and improprieties that arise from this custom. With an introduction that sets the stage, a treatise on the milk, and an appendix that further explores the subject, this work delves into the heart of a contentious issue, offering a fresh perspective that will leave readers questioning long-held beliefs.
