Synopsis: 
In 'Three Plays' by Luigi Pirandello, the reader is taken on a captivating journey through three distinct stories that delve into the complexities of human nature and the blurred lines between reality and illusion.

The second play follows the life of a woman who becomes entangled in a web of deceit and manipulation, questioning the authenticity of her relationships. Lastly, the third play revolves around a group of actors rehearsing a play that mirrors their own lives, blurring the boundaries between fiction and reality. With each play, Pirandello masterfully crafts thought-provoking narratives that challenge our understanding of truth and the masks we wear in society.
