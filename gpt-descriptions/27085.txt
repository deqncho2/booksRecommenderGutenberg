Synopsis: In 'Rootabaga Stories', Carl Sandburg takes readers on a whimsical journey through a land where turnips grow on trees, potato faces come to life, and the moon gets caught in a spider's web. This collection of imaginative tales introduces us to a cast of eccentric characters, including the Potato Face Blind Man, the Balloon Pickers, and the Blue Wind Boy. With his signature blend of humor and poetry, Sandburg invites readers to explore a world where anything is possible and where the ordinary becomes extraordinary.
