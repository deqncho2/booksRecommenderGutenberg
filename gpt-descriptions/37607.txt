Synopsis: In "Garden Design and Architects' Gardens: Two reviews," William Robinson challenges the conventional practice of clipping and aligning trees to conform to architectural structures. Through vivid examples from British gardens, Robinson argues that this approach is not only barbarous and needless but also lacks artistic value. By showcasing the beauty and natural harmony of untouched trees, the author aims to inspire a new perspective on garden design that embraces the inherent aesthetics of nature.
