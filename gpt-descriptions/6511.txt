Synopsis: In 'The suppressed Gospels and Epistles of the original New Testament of Jesus the Christ, Volume 5, St. Paul', author William Wake delves into the lesser-known writings of the apostle Paul, shedding light on his teachings and experiences that were omitted from the traditional New Testament. This volume uncovers a treasure trove of ancient texts that challenge our understanding of Paul's role in early Christianity and offer a fresh perspective on his relationship with Jesus. As we explore these suppressed writings, we are invited to question the established narrative and embark on a journey of discovery that reveals a more complex and enigmatic figure than we ever imagined.
