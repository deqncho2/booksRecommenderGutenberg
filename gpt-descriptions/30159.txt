Synopsis: 

In 'The True-Born Englishman: A Satire', Daniel Defoe takes a sharp and witty look at the complexities of national identity and the absurdities of prejudice. Through a series of humorous and thought-provoking anecdotes, Defoe challenges the notion of what it truly means to be a "true-born Englishman." With biting satire and clever wordplay, he exposes the contradictions and hypocrisies that arise when people try to define themselves based on their ancestry or birthplace. This satirical work offers a fresh perspective on the timeless themes of identity, belonging, and the human tendency to judge others based on superficial criteria.
