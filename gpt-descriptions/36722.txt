Synopsis: "The Revision Revised: Three Articles Reprinted from the 'Quarterly Review'" by John William Burgon is a thought-provoking and controversial examination of the revisions made to the Greek text and English version of the New Testament. In this work, Burgon critiques the new textual theory proposed by Westcott and Hort, while also responding to Bishop Ellicott's defense of the revisers. Additionally, he presents a compelling vindication of the traditional reading of 1 Timothy III. 16. Through meticulous analysis and persuasive arguments, Burgon challenges the prevailing views on biblical translation and textual criticism.
