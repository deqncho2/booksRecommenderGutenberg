Synopsis: In 'Researches on curves of the second order: Also on cones and spherical conics treated analytically, in which the tangencies of Apollonius are investigated, and general geometrical constructions deduced from analysis; also several of the geometrical conclusions of M. Chasles are analytically resolved, together with many properties entirely original', George Whitehead Hearn delves into the fascinating world of curves, cones, and spherical conics. Through analytical investigation, he explores the tangencies of Apollonius and uncovers various geometrical constructions derived from analysis. Additionally, Hearn resolves several of M. Chasles' geometrical conclusions analytically, while introducing numerous entirely original properties. This work promises to captivate readers with its exploration of mathematical concepts and its innovative approach to geometry.
