Synopsis: 

In the "Report of the naval committee to the House of Representatives, August, 1850," the Committee on Naval Affairs presents a compelling case for the establishment of a line of mail steamships to the western coast of Africa, with a route extending via the Mediterranean to London. The primary objective of this proposal is to promote the emigration of free persons of color from the United States to Liberia, a country founded by freed American slaves. Additionally, the report argues that this initiative would contribute to the expansion of the steam navy and the enhancement of the United States' commerce.
