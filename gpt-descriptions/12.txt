Synopsis: 
In 'Through the Looking-Glass', Lewis Carroll takes readers on another whimsical journey into a world where logic is turned upside down and imagination reigns supreme. Alice, our curious and intrepid protagonist, steps through a mirror into a fantastical realm filled with talking flowers, eccentric characters, and mind-bending puzzles. As she navigates this topsy-turvy world, Alice encounters a chessboard landscape where she must become a pawn and make her way to the other side to become a queen. Along the way, she encounters peculiar creatures such as the Red Queen, the White Queen, and the mischievous Humpty Dumpty, each challenging her with their own peculiar logic. With each encounter, Alice's understanding of herself and the world around her is tested, leading her to question the nature of reality and the power of imagination.
