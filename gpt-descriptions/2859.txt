Synopsis: 
In 'A Little Dinner at Timmins's', Thackeray takes us into the heart of Victorian society, where a seemingly ordinary dinner party becomes a stage for hidden desires, secret alliances, and unexpected revelations. As the guests gather around the table, tensions rise and the facade of polite society begins to crack, exposing the true nature of the characters. With wit and satire, Thackeray explores the complexities of human relationships and the masks we wear to navigate the social hierarchy of the time.
