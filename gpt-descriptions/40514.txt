Synopsis: 

In "Minority Report of the Committee on Railways in Relation to the Hoosac Tunnel and the Railroads Leading Thereto," the Massachusetts General Court's Committee on Railways and Canals presents a compelling argument regarding the construction of the Hoosac Tunnel and the railroads associated with it. This report challenges the prevailing opinions and offers a unique perspective on the matter. Accompanying the report is a bill proposing the incorporation of the State Board of Trustees of the Hoosac Tunnel Railroad, which aims to address the concerns raised in the report. Additionally, the book includes the powerful speech delivered by Hon. E. P. Carpenter in the Senate of Massachusetts, passionately advocating for the implementation of the proposed bill.
