Synopsis: 

'The Grey Book: A collection of protests against anti-Semitism and the persecution of Jews issued by non-Roman Catholic churches and church leaders during Hitler's rule' by Johan M. Snoek is a powerful and eye-opening compilation of courageous voices that dared to speak out against the atrocities committed during one of history's darkest periods. 

This book delves into the lesser-known stories of various non-Roman Catholic churches and their leaders who defied the prevailing climate of fear and oppression to condemn anti-Semitism and advocate for the rights and protection of Jews. Through a collection of documents, letters, and statements, Snoek sheds light on the moral courage and resilience of these individuals who risked their own safety to stand up against the Nazi regime.
