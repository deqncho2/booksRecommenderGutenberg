Synopsis: In "A Proposal for the Better Supplying of Churches in Our Foreign Plantations, and for Converting the Savage Americans to Christianity, By a College to Be Erected in the Summer Islands, Otherwise Called the Isles of Bermuda," George Berkeley presents a visionary plan to establish a college in Bermuda with the aim of spreading Christianity to the indigenous people and improving the religious infrastructure in the foreign plantations. Through his persuasive arguments, Berkeley proposes a unique solution to address the spiritual needs of the colonists and the native inhabitants, ultimately challenging conventional methods of missionary work.
