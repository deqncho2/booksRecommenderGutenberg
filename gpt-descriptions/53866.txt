Synopsis: In "Thoughts on the Proposed Inclosure of Waltham (commonly called Epping) and Hainault Forests," Thomas Street presents a compelling argument against the inclosure of these beloved forests. As he explores the potential consequences of such an action, Street proposes an alternative plan for disafforesting the area. With the heads of the bill now proposed for that purpose, the reader is taken on a thought-provoking journey that challenges the status quo and offers a fresh perspective on the preservation of nature.
