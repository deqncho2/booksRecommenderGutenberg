Synopsis: 
In the aftermath of World War I, a group of disillusioned expatriates find themselves entangled in a whirlwind of love, friendship, and adventure in the vibrant streets of 1920s Paris and the bullfighting arenas of Pamplona. Jake Barnes, a war veteran, and his eccentric group of friends embark on a journey filled with passion, longing, and the pursuit of meaning in a world that seems to have lost its way. As they navigate the complexities of love and desire, they are forced to confront their own insecurities and the harsh realities of a post-war society. With Hemingway's signature spare prose and vivid descriptions, "The Sun Also Rises" is a captivating exploration of the lost generation's search for purpose and authenticity.
