The second work, 'The Knave of Hearts' by George Canning, published in 1787, continues the tradition of ballad parody. Canning's work humorously mocks the sentimental ballad genre, presenting a comical and exaggerated version of the traditional love story. With its clever wordplay and humorous twists, 'The Knave of Hearts' offers a delightful and entertaining read.
