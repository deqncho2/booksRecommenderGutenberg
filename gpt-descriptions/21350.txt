Synopsis: 

'Roister Doister' is a delightful and humorous play written by Nicholas Udall, believed to have been written and possibly performed before 1553. This carefully edited version is based on the unique copy found at Eton College. The story revolves around the misadventures of a boastful and love-struck gentleman named Roister Doister, who is determined to win the heart of a beautiful widow named Dame Custance. However, his plans are constantly thwarted by a comical cast of characters, including his rival, Matthew Merrygreek, and a group of meddling friends. As the plot unfolds, the audience is taken on a rollicking journey filled with mistaken identities, clever wordplay, and uproarious situations.
