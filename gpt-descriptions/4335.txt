Synopsis: In "The Grounds of an Opinion on the Policy of Restricting the Importation of Foreign Corn," Thomas Robert Malthus presents a compelling argument that challenges the prevailing views on the importation of foreign corn. Through a meticulous analysis of economic principles and historical data, Malthus explores the potential consequences of restricting the importation of foreign corn and offers a thought-provoking perspective on the policy. This appendix serves as a valuable addition to his earlier work, "Observations on the corn laws," providing readers with a deeper understanding of the complex issues surrounding agricultural policies and their impact on society.
