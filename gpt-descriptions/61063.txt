Synopsis: 

In "Negroes and Negro "Slavery:" the first an inferior race: the latter its normal condition," John H. Van Evrie delves into a controversial exploration of race and slavery in America. Through a combination of historical analysis and scientific theories, Van Evrie argues that African Americans are an inherently inferior race and that slavery is their natural state. He presents a range of evidence, including biological and social factors, to support his claims. This thought-provoking work challenges conventional beliefs and raises important questions about race, equality, and the legacy of slavery in America.
