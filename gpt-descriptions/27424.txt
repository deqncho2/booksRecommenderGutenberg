Synopsis: 
In "Cautionary Tales for Children," Hilaire Belloc presents a collection of darkly humorous and cautionary poems that warn children of the consequences of misbehavior. From the tale of Matilda, who told lies and was burned to death, to the story of Jim, who ran away from his nurse and was eaten by a lion, each cautionary tale serves as a witty and entertaining lesson for young readers. With clever rhymes and unexpected twists, Belloc's tales will captivate both children and adults alike, leaving them with a lingering sense of caution and a newfound appreciation for the consequences of their actions.
