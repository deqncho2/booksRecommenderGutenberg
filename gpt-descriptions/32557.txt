Synopsis: 
'An Humble Address and Earnest Appeal to Those Respectable Personages in Great-Britain and Ireland' is a thought-provoking and persuasive work by Josiah Tucker. In this compelling piece, Tucker addresses the influential individuals in Great Britain and Ireland who possess significant landed property, a liberal education, elevated rank, and broad perspectives. He appeals to their ability to judge and decide whether maintaining a connection with or separating from the Continental Colonies of America would be most advantageous for the nation and the lasting benefit of these kingdoms. Through a series of well-reasoned arguments, Tucker explores the potential consequences and benefits of both options, urging the reader to carefully consider the national advantage and the long-term implications of their decision.
