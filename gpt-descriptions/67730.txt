Synopsis: In "Farnham's Travels in the Great Western Prairies, etc., part 2, October 21-December 4, 1839: and De Smet's Oregon Missions and Travels over the Rocky Mountains, 1845-1846," two intrepid explorers embark on separate journeys through the vast and untamed landscapes of the American West. Farnham's expedition takes place in the late 1830s, while De Smet's mission occurs a few years later. As they traverse the Great Western Prairies and the Rocky Mountains, both men encounter breathtaking natural wonders, encounter Native American tribes, and face numerous challenges that test their resilience and determination. Through their vivid accounts, readers are transported to a time when the West was still largely uncharted territory, and the spirit of adventure was at its peak.
