The second story brings us to the early 20th century, where we meet Simon's descendants, who are faced with the challenges of maintaining their Jewish identity amidst a rapidly changing world. Through these interconnected tales, the novel explores the complexities of Jewish life, the enduring power of family bonds, and the struggle to preserve tradition in the face of modernity.
