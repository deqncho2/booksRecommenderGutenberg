Synopsis: In 'A Discourse of Life and Death, by Mornay; and Antonius by Garnier', two influential thinkers of their time explore the profound questions surrounding life and death. Mornay's discourse delves into the nature of existence and the inevitability of mortality, while Garnier's play Antonius presents a gripping tale of love, power, and the consequences of one's actions. As these two works intertwine, they offer a thought-provoking exploration of the human condition and the complexities of our existence.
