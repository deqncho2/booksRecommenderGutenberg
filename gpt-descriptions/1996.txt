Synopsis: 
In the second volume of Dante Alighieri's epic poem, 'The Divine Comedy', we follow the journey of the poet as he continues his exploration of the afterlife. After traversing the depths of Hell, Dante now finds himself in Purgatory, a place of purification and redemption. Guided by the Roman poet Virgil, he encounters a multitude of souls who are undergoing various forms of penance to cleanse themselves of their sins. As Dante ascends the mountain of Purgatory, he witnesses the transformative power of repentance and the hope of salvation. Along the way, he encounters familiar faces, engages in philosophical discussions, and witnesses awe-inspiring visions that challenge his understanding of the divine.
