Synopsis: 

'Letters on the Cholera Morbus' challenges the prevailing beliefs about the transmission of the disease, presenting ample evidence that it cannot be spread from person to person through contact, inanimate objects, or the atmosphere. The authors argue that the restrictions imposed by cordons and quarantine regulations are not only useless but also harmful to the community. Through a series of letters, they provide a compelling case against the commonly accepted understanding of the disease's transmission.
