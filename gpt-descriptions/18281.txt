Synopsis: In this gripping account, the anonymous author takes us back to the year 1872, when Susan B. Anthony, a prominent women's rights activist, stood trial for the audacious act of casting her vote in the presidential election. The narrative not only delves into the legal proceedings surrounding Anthony's case but also explores the subsequent trial of the three election inspectors who allowed her vote. With vivid descriptions and compelling courtroom drama, this book sheds light on the challenges faced by women in their fight for suffrage and the lengths they were willing to go to secure their rights.
