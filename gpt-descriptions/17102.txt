Synopsis: In 'An Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog', Goldsmith takes us on a darkly humorous journey through a small town's encounter with a rabid canine. As the dog's madness spreads chaos and fear, the townspeople's reactions become increasingly absurd and unexpected. Through witty verses and clever observations, Goldsmith explores the irrationality of human behavior and the unpredictable nature of life itself.
