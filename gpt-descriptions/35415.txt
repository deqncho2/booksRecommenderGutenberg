In 'Jewish Immigration to the United States from 1881 to 1910: Studies in History, Economics and Public Law, Vol. LIX, No. 4, 1914', Samuel Joseph delves into the fascinating and often overlooked period of Jewish immigration to the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Through meticulous research and analysis, Joseph uncovers the complex factors that drove this wave of immigration and explores the profound impact it had on both Jewish communities and American society as a whole.
